            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Aditi Raj, currently pursuing B.Tech with a specialization in Computer Science from ITER. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a strong passion for coding. During my time at university, I actively participated in extracurricular activities, clubs, and projects. For example, I was involved in HackWar, where I was a team leader. This experience helped me develop valuable skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication. While I am new to the professional world, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to make a meaningful contribution.</p>
            <p>I enjoy dancing, which has taught me discipline, the ability to work under pressure, and improved my coordination, creativity, and collaboration skills. I use dance as a form of stress relief and to maintain a healthy work-life balance. These qualities would benefit my job. Overall, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to embark on this new chapter in my career journey and contribute to a company's success.</p>
            <p>My ability to work well with others is one of my strongest professional attributes. I have always enjoyed working as part of a team and find that my collaborative nature is a key strength. In my last role as a project leader, I was able to meet all deadlines and deliverables by improving team collaboration through new processes and software. I am confident that I can bring this strength to your team and contribute to building a positive, collaborative work environment.</p>
            <p><strong>CGPA:</strong> 8.0</p>
